AI Used-

Model:

- ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-4)

Reason :

AI became necessary for the project to solve two critical problems which included:

- AI assistance became necessary to solve the PowerShell 'curl' JSON payload issue because PowerShell maps curl to Invoke-WebRequest by default.

- The solution to pytest test discovery ModuleNotFoundError needed PYTHONPATH and pytest.ini guidance from AI.

- AI generated a better .gitignore template which excluded virtual environments and cache files and other unwanted files.

The AI-generated modifications underwent human review to guarantee proper adjustments.

All other project components including main logic routing tests and structure were independently implemented.

The AI-generated code was thoroughly examined before adoption and all program logic was fully understood before using it.
